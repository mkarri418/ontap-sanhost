== Installing the Linux Unified Host Utilities

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=91704;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 no_path_retry fail
}
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 no_path_retry queue
 path_checker tur
 }

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1284293[1284293^] | Kernel disruption occurs on SLES12 SP5 with QLogic QLE2562 8GB FC HBA during storage failover operations | Kernel disruption occurs during storage failover operations on the SLES12 SP5 kernel with a QLogic QLE2562 Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter (HBA). The kernel disruption causes SLES12 SP5 to reboot, leading to application disruption. If the kdump mechanism is enabled, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file located in the /var/crash/ directory. Check the vmcore file to determine the cause of the disruption. A storage failover with a QLogic QLE2562 HBA event affects the "THREAD_INFO: ffff8aedf723c2c0" module. Locate this event in the vmcore file by finding the following string: " [THREAD_INFO: ffff8aedf723c2c0]".
After the kernel disruption, reboot the host OS to enable it to recover. Then restart the applications.
