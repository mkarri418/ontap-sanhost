== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=84067;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_san_booting_steps.adoc[]

== Multipathing

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs. Use the `+multipath -ll+` command verify the settings for your ONTAP LUNs.

There should be two groups of paths with different priorities. The paths with the higher priorities are Active/Optimized, meaning they are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located. The paths with the lower priorities are active but are non-optimized because they are served from a different controller. The non-optimized paths are only used when no optimized paths are available.

.Example
The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/Non-Optimized paths.

----
# multipath -ll
3600a09803831347657244e527766394e dm-5 NETAPP,LUN C-Mode
size=80G features='3 queue_if_no_path pg_init_retries 50' hwhandler='1 alua' wp=rw
|-+- policy='service-time 0' prio=50 status=enabled
| |- 11:0:1:0 sdj 8:144 active ready running
| |- 11:0:2:0 sdr 65:16 active ready running
`-+- policy='service-time 0' prio=10 status=enabled
|- 11:0:0:0 sdb 8:i6 active ready running
|- 12:0:0:0 sdz 65:144 active ready running
----

Do not use an excessive number of paths to a single LUN. No more than 4 paths should be required. More than 8 paths might cause path issues during storage failures.

== Recommended Settings

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}
devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }

| iSCSI boot from SAN fails to boot with a static IP configuration after completing an SLES15SP2 OS installation

a| iSCSI sanbooted LUN failed to boot up after completing an SLES 15 SP2 OS installation with a static IP configuration. Bootup failure occurs every time with the static IP configuration. This leads to the server refusing to continue the boot up process with the following error message:

----
dracut-cmdline[241]: warning: Empty autoconf values default to dhcp

dracut: FATAL: FATAL: For argument ip=eth4:static, setting client-ip does not make sense for dhcp

dracut: Refusing to continue

reboot: System halted
