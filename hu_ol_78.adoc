== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=90144;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux (OL) 7.8 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. OL 7.8 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

include::_include/hu/reuse_hu_multipathing_non_asa.adoc[]
The following sections provide sample multipath output for a LUN mapped non-ASA personas.

== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 7.8 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 path_checker tur
 detect_prio yes
 }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1311575[1311575^] | IO delays observed due to Read/Write operations failed to switch through secondary paths during storage failover with Qlogic QLE2672(16G) | I/O operations might fail to resume through secondary paths during storage failover operations on Oracle Linux 7.7 kernel (5.4.17-2011.0.7.el7uek.x86_6) with QLogic QLE2672 16G HBA. If I/O progress stops due to blocked primary paths during storage failover, the I/O operation might not resume through secondary paths causing an I/O delay. The I/O operation resumes only after primary paths come online after the completion of the storage failover giveback operation. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17171[17171^]

The storage failover operation reports change from "online" state to "blocked" state, causing a delay in read and write operations. After the operation is completed successfully, the reports fail to move back to "online" state and continue to remain in "blocked" state. | link:https://bugzilla.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16852[16852^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1246327[1246327^] | IO delays observed and Rports are moving to blocked, NOT PRESENT state during storage failover with Qlogic QLE2672(16G) and QLE2742(32G) | Fibre Channel (FC) remote ports might be blocked on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.6 with the QLogic QLE2672 16G host during storage failover operations. Because the logical interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote ports set the storage node status to blocked. IO progress might stop due to the blocked ports if you are running both a QLogic QLE2672 16G host and a QLE2742 32GB Fibre Channel (FC) host bus adapter (HBA).
When the storage node returns to its optimal state, the logical interfaces also come up and the remote ports should be online. However, the remote ports might still be blocked. This blocked state registers as failed faulty to LUNS at the multipath layer. You can verify the state of the remote ports with the following command:
# cat /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_stat
You should see the following output:
