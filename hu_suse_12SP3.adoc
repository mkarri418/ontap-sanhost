== Installing the Linux Unified Host Utilities

== SAN Toolkit

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=80043;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 no_path_retry fail
}
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 no_path_retry queue
 path_checker tur
 }

| link:https://https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1089555[1089555^] | Kernel disruption observed on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 16GB FC during storage failover operation | A kernel disruption might occur during storage failover operations on kernel version SLES12 SP3 with Emulex LPe16002 HBA. The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module “lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_ringtxcmpl_put+51.

Recover the operating system after the kernel disruption by rebooting the host operating system and restarting the application. | link:http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1042847[1042847^]

The kernel disruption prompts a reboot of the operating system, which in turn causes an application disruption. If the kdump is configured, the kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/directory. You can investigate the cause of the failure in the vmcore file.
Example:
In the observed case, the kernel disruption was observed in the module
“lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76” and is logged in the vmcore file
– exception RIP: lpfc_sli_free_hbq+76.

The kernel panic leads to a reboot of the operating system, causing an application disruption. The kernel panic generates the vmcore file under the /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. Upon the kernel panic, the vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case, the panic was observed in the “blk_finish_request+289” module.
It is logged in the vmcore file with the following string:
"exception RIP: blk_finish_request+289"

After the kernel disruption, you can recover the operating system  by rebooting the Host OS. You can restart the application as required. | link:http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1062496[1062496^]

This prompts a reboot of the operating system causing application disruption. The kernel disruption generates a vmcore file under /var/crash/ directory if kdump is configured. The vmcore file can be used to understand the cause of the failure.
Example:
In this case the Kernel disruption was observed in the module "unknown or invalid address" and is logged in vmcore file with the following string - exception RIP: unknown or invalid address.
