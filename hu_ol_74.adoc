== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=80004;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Oracle Linux 7.4 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. Oracle Linux 7.4 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The Oracle Linux 7.4 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `detect_prio` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
 path_checker readsector0
 detect_prio no
 }
devices {
 device {
 vendor "NETAPP "
 product "LUN.*"
 path_checker tur
 detect_prio yes
 }
}

| Bugzilla ID
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1109468[1109468] | Firmware dumps observed on an OL7.4 Hypervisor with QLE8362 card |During storage failover operations on an OL7.4 Hypervisor with QLE8362 card,  the firmware dumps are observed occasionally. The firmware dumps might result in an I/O outage on the host, which might go up to 500 seconds. After the adapter completes the firmware dump, the I/O operation resumes in the normal manner. No further recovery procedure is required on the host. To indicate the firmware dump, the following message is displayed in the /var/log/message file:
 qla2xxx [0000:0c:00.3]-d001:8: Firmware dump saved to temp buffer (8/ffffc90008901000), dump status flags (0x3f)
