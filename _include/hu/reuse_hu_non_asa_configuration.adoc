=== Non-ASA Configuration

For non-ASA configuration there should be two groups of paths with different priorities. The paths with the higher priorities are Active/Optimized, meaning they are serviced by the controller where the aggregate is located. The paths with the lower priorities are active but are non-optimized because they are served from a different controller. The non-optimized paths are only used when no optimized paths are available.

The following example displays the correct output for an ONTAP LUN with two Active/Optimized paths and two Active/non-Optimized paths:
