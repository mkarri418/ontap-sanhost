== Installing the Linux Unified Host Utilities

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=77603;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.9 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. RHEL 6.9 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 6.9 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1067272[1067272^] | Remote port status on EMULEX LPe32002 host might be in 'Blocked' state during storage failover operations | During storage failover operations, certain remote port status on RHEL 6.9 host with LPe32002 adapter might get into 'Blocked' state. Because the logical   interfaces go down when a storage node is down, the remote port sets the storage node status to "Blocked" state.  However, when the storage node comes back to optimal state, the logical interfaces also comes up and the remote port state is expected to be 'Online'.  But, on certain occasion the remote port continues to be in 'Blocked' state.  This state manifests as 'failed faulty' to LUNS at multipath layer. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427496[427496^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=1076584[1076584^] | Firmware dumps occur on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.9 QLogic QE8362 HBA during storage failover operations | Firmware dumps can occur during storage failover operations on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.9 hosts with QLogic QLE8362 host bus adapters (HBA), firmware dumps are observed occasionally. The firmware dumps might manifest as an I/O outage on the host that can last as long as 1200 seconds. After the adapter completes dumping the firmware cores, the I/O operation resumes normally.  No further recovery procedure is required on the host. To indicate the firmware dump, the following message is displayed in /var/log/ message file: kernel: qla2xxx [0000:0c:00.3]-d001:3: Firmware dump saved to temp buffer (3/ffffc90018b01000), dump status flags (0x3f) | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1438711[1438711^]
