== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=63797;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.4 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. RHEL 6.4 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 6.4 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }

| Bugzilla ID
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=673009[673009^] | Creating ext4 file system on LV striped across 15 or more discard-enabled, thinly provisioned multipath devices triggers "request botched" kernel errors | "Request blotched" kernel errors have been seen when users attempt to create an ext4 file system on discard-enabled, thinly provisioned multipath devices. As a result, creating the ext4 file system might take longer to complete and occasional disruption occurs. This issue has occurred only when users attempt to create the ext4 file system on a LV striped across 15 or more discard-enabled multipath devices on systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x and Data ONTAP 8.1.3 and later operating in 7-Mode. The issue happens because the kernel erroneously attempts to merge discard requests, which is not supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x at this time. When this issue occurs, multiple instances of the following message are written to syslog (/var/log/messages):  kernel: blk: request botched. As a result, file system creation might take longer time to complete than expected. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=907844[907844^]
