== Supportability

NVMe/FC is supported on ONTAP 9.7 or later for Windows Server 2016.

include::_include/nvme/reuse_supportability_notes.adoc[]

== Known limitations

Windows Failover Cluster (WFC) is not supported with ONTAP NVMe/FC because ONTAP does not currently support persistent reservations with NVMe/FC.

NOTE: The external driver shipped by Broadcom for Windows NVMe/FC is not a true NVMe/FC driver but a translational SCSI ⇄ NVMe driver. This translational overhead does not necessarily impact performance, but it does negate the performance benefits of NVMe/FC. Thus, on Windows servers, NVMe/FC and FCP performance is the same, unlike on other operating systems such as Linux, where NVMe/FC performance is significantly better than that of FCP.
