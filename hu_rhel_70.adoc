== Installing the Linux Unified Host Utilities

== SAN Booting

.Before you begin
If you decide to use SAN booting, it must be supported by your configuration. You can use the link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix/imt.jsp?components=68128;&solution=1&isHWU&src=IMT[NetApp Interoperability Matrix Tool^] to verify that your OS, HBA, HBA firmware and the HBA boot BIOS, and ONTAP version are supported.

== Multipathing

For Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0 the /etc/multipath.conf file must exist, but you do not need to make specific changes to the file. RHEL 7.0 is compiled with all settings required to recognize and correctly manage ONTAP LUNs.

== Recommended Settings

The RHEL 7.0 OS is compiled to recognize ONTAP LUNs and automatically set all configuration parameters correctly for both ASA and non-ASA configuration.

.Example

The following example shows how to correct an overridden default. In this case, the `multipath.conf` file defines values for `path_checker` and `no_path_retry` that are not compatible with ONTAP LUNs. If they cannot be removed because of other SAN arrays still attached to the host, these parameters can be corrected specifically for ONTAP LUNs with a device stanza.

----
defaults {
   path_checker      readsector0
   no_path_retry      fail
}

devices {
   device {
      vendor         "NETAPP  "
      product         "LUN.*"
      no_path_retry     queue
      path_checker      tur
   }
}

| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836800[836800^] | Anaconda displays an iSCSI login failure message although logins are successful during RHEL 7.0 OS installation | When you install the root(/) on a iSCSI multipath’d LUN, the IP address for the  Ethernet interfaces are specified in the kernel command line so that the IP addresses are assigned before the iSCSI service starts. However, dracut cannot assign IP addresses to all the Ethernet ports during the boot, before the iSCSI service starts. This causes the iSCSI login to fail on interfaces without IP addresses. You will see the iSCSI service attempt to login numerous times,  which will cause a delay in the OS boot time. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1114966[1114966^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836875[836875^] | IP addresses are not always assigned during the boot of a RHEL 7.0 OS installed on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN | When you are installing RHEL 7.0, the anaconda installation screen displays that iSCSI login to multiple target IPs have failed though the iSCSI logins are successful. Anaconda displays following error message: “Node Login Failed” You will observe this error only when you select multiple target IPs for iSCSI login. You can continue the OS installation by clicking the "ok" button. This bug does not hamper either the iSCSI or the RHEL 7.0 OS installation. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1114820[1114820^]
| link:https://mysupport.netapp.com/NOW/cgi-bin/bol?Type=Detail&Display=836657[836657^] | Anaconda does not add bootdev argument in kernel cmd line to set IP address for RHEL 7.0 OS installed on iSCSI multipath'd LUN | Anaconda does not add a bootdev argument in the kernel command line where you set the IPv4 address during the RHEL 7.0 OS installation on an iSCSI multipath'd LUN. This prevents assigning of IP addresses to any of the Ethernet interfaces that were configured to establish iSCSI sessions with the storage subsystem during the RHEL 7.0 boot. Since iSCSI sessions are not established, the root LUN is not discovered when the OS boots and hence the OS boot fails. | link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1114464[1114464^]
